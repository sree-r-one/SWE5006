## Commit Message Guidelines

### Commit Message Format
Use the following structure for commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

#### 1. **Type**
The type describes the nature of the change. Use one of the following keywords:

- `feat`: A new feature (e.g., `feat(ui): add user login`)
- `fix`: A bug fix (e.g., `fix(api): resolve timeout issue`)
- `docs`: Documentation updates (e.g., `docs(readme): update setup steps`)
- `style`: Code formatting or style changes (e.g., `style(ui): fix alignment`)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- `test`: Adding or updating tests.
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (e.g., dependency updates).

#### 2. **Scope** (Optional)
The scope specifies the area of the codebase being changed, e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`, `docs`.

#### 3. **Subject**
A short, imperative description of the change:
- Limit to 50 characters.
- Start with a verb (e.g., `add`, `fix`, `update`).
- Do not capitalize the first word or add a period at the end.

**Example:** `feat(ui): add drag-and-drop functionality`

#### 4. **Body** (Optional)
Provide additional context or explanation for the change:
- Describe **what** and **why**, but not **how**.
- Wrap text at 72 characters.

**Example:**
```
fix(api): resolve response parsing issue

Resolved a bug where API responses were incorrectly parsed, causing
errors in the frontend display. Added unit tests to cover edge cases.
```

#### 5. **Footer** (Optional)
Use to reference issues or note breaking changes:
- Format for issues: `Closes #<issue-number>`.
- Format for breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`.

**Example:**
```
