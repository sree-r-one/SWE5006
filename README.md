## Overview

The Explore Singapore Application is a group project designed as part of a NUS Mtech Module SWE5006. The goal is to provide users with personalized itineraries and suggestions to explore Singapore's landmarks, attractions, and cultural hotspots. Leveraging AI-powered features, the app aims to offer unique and tailored experiences to both locals and tourists.

This repository includes:
1. A frontend built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS using Vite for rapid development and hot module replacement.
2. A backend built with Python and FastAPI, containerized using Docker. It exposes API endpoints to serve data and handle AI-powered itinerary logic (e.g., calls to OpenAI APIs).

## Features
- **Custom Itineraries:** Generate personalized day-by-day travel plans in JSON format.
- **Attraction Recommendations:** Get curated suggestions based on user preferences.
- **Interactive UI:** Seamless navigation and engaging user experience powered by React and TypeScript.
- **AI Integration:** Utilizes advanced AI capabilities to provide insightful recommendations.
- **RESTful API Backend**: Handles data retrieval, AI logic, and endpoints for managing user requests.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:sree-r-one/SWE5006.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
